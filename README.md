The astro_data_tools package contains code for organizing, manipulating, and plotting data generated by astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations, and is specifically designed for use with the Athena++ library. I wrote this package as part of my undergraduate thesis in the Physics Department at Princeton University to expedite the interpretation and presentation of results from my computational experiments.

The Athena++ source code can be accessed at https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena-public-version.
